# vis
Mapped-based data visualisations, often of London and/or transport/transit.

* vis/tube - see it live at http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/ and http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/closures/ with more information at http://oobrien.com/2014/01/london-tube-stats/ and http://oobrien.com/2014/10/tube-tongues/
* vis/panopticon - see it live at http://vis.oobrien.com/panopticon/ with more information at http://oobrien.com/2016/04/london-panopticon/

Probably of most interest is https://github.com/oobrien/vis/blob/master/tube/data/tfl_lines.json and https://github.com/oobrien/vis/blob/master/tube/data/tfl_stations.json - these data are from OpenStreetMap, with some minor editing by myself. They include the Crossrail alignment. They are simplified to only show one line for each running tunnel pair, and stations represented by a node on the line.

Under vis/tube/data:

* 2015-* and rods_od - This is from the TfL Open Data portal and based on an amended version of the OGL which is compatible with CC-By.
* 2247.json - This is from MySociety MapIt and OS Open Data (OGL)
* london_wards_2011_centroids - from the ONS (OGL)
* osis - This is collated from http://content.tfl.gov.uk/out-of-station-interchanges.pdf
* qs* - This is from the ONS Census outputs (OGL)
* river_thames_simp - from OS Open Data (OGL)
* stats - this is collated from various old reports from TfL, some of which are no longer on its website.
* tfl_* - this is derived from OpenStreetMap. The original data is under the ODbL. I have made edits to the data and so it is CC-By-NC.
